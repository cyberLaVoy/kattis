Write a program, written in a programing language of your choice, that solves the following problem.

Problem Introduction:
On a N by N chess board, two players alternate placing a knight on the board. A knight can only be placed if there is no other knight which would be either 1 row and 2 columns or 2 rows and 1 column away from it. The first player who cannot place a knight on the board loses.

Given the size of the board, compute if the first or second player wins.

Program Input:
The first and only line contains the integer N (1 <= N <= 1000), the size of the board.

Program Output:
Output first if the first player wins the game, or second if the second player wins the game.
